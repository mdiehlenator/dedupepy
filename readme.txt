Have you ever had to move files or directories around in order to free up space on your hard drive?

Ya, I have.  Then, I've moved them around and eventually lost track of where all of these files went.

Then, I've found myself having to reconcile the possibility that I've got duplicate files scattered all 
over my file system.
